					<p> In the 19th century, Alice's father, Charles Kingsley, who was in a meeting about business,
						began by
						putting her to sleep when little Alice, who had a nightmare, came. The father was an open-minded
						man
						who did not fit the century, and Alice was greatly influenced by him.</p>
					<p>Alice, 19, rides a wagon to an engagement party that only she doesn't know. And dancing with Mama
						Boy Hamish, he speaks his mind, but Hamish doesn't understand such Alice and tells her to come
						to
						the pavilion exactly 10 minutes later. Then the twin sisters show up and reveal that Hamish is
						going
						to propose, and Alice's older sister Margaret, who finds it, angrily takes them and tells them
						it
						was actually an engagement party. Alice, who doesn't want to marry and live stiflingly to pushy
						and
						uninteresting Hamish, refuses, but her sister scolds her.</p>
					
						<p> The way of thinking of the century is
						getting scary. While her mother-in-law was taking a breathtaking garden walk and listening to
						all
						kinds of patriarchal nagging, Alice, who found the rabbit, found her aunt and discovered the
						scene
						of her brother-in-law's affair. Then, half-forced by Hemish in front of more than 100 people,
						Alice
						runs away with the white rabbit and falls into a cave under the tree, as if it were broken. The
						oraculum says "Alice's Return Day" from the Red Queen era.</p>

									<p>
										Alice, who does something else while listening to her sister's history story, is
										an imaginative girl. Alice imagines a world where animals and plants such as
										cats and flowers speak human words and books only have pictures instead of
										letters. Alice daydreams, saying that her world must be a strange country, and
										at that moment she sees a white rabbit running away. Alice, who was about to
										enter the rabbit hole where the rabbit disappeared, suddenly falls into the
										hole, but Alice's skirt swells up due to the wind and acts as a blue parachute,
										and thanks to her skirt, Alice slowly goes down. And after a long time, they
										chase the rabbit again.
										The rabbit door was opened in layers, and when he entered, he found a very small
										door. I thought the door handle would say something, but when Alice tried to
										pass, she told me to take medicine on the table, saying it was too big. Alice,
										who took the medicine, soon became smaller and pleased to ask for permission to
										pass, suddenly tackles that the handle left the key behind. Then somewhere, a
										box of snacks appears and Alice eats them, and this
										time she becomes very big. Alice burst into tears in sorrow that she could not
										get smaller again, and the tears fell to form the sea, and this time she drank
										all the medicine in the bottle according to the advice of the door handle, it
										became too small.

										His real name is Charles Rutwidge Dodgson and Lewis Carroll. She is widely known
										as a Victorian mathematician, novelist, photographer, and author of Alice in
										Wonderland, and a leading author of early photographic history.
										Representative works include Alice in Wonderland published in 1865, and Alice in
										Mirrorland published in 1872. The impact of this work on society as a whole was
										great. There was no field without Alice Mania, which inspired philosophers,
										mathematicians, physicists, and psychologists. Especially in physics, it is
										cited as the licorice of medicinal herbs when describing Big Bang cosmology,
										Chaos theory, relativity theory, and quantum mechanics. There's even a disease
										called Alice's syndrome in Wonderland.
